This sink was modified by tanzhenghai based on flume-spillable-memory-channel
which can backup events in memroy when flume stops, and recover at next startup


As you know, events in flume memroy channel will be discarded when flume stoped or reload configuration file.
Though spillable-memory channel was supplied in flume-1.5, but only events in the file channel were can recovered. spillable-memory channel was a memory channel extends on file channel.


if flume crashed, only events can be recovered.
